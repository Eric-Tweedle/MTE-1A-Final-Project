# MTE-1A-Final-Project
The code used on my final project for my first semester in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. The code operated Lego NXT devices to run an autonomous sandwich maker. The code is written in Robot C. I was the main programmer for this project but there were contributions from my group partners Ben Holmes, Morgan Yeung and Cameron Blair.
